# Adaptive Depression Detection System

Our goal is to build an adaptive depression detection system. The system should be
based on a local area, specially targeted towards the students and faculty members of
Shahjalal University and Science and Technology. The subject will get a set of questions,
and from the responses the system shall provide an accurate measurement of whether
or not the subject is under depression. The source of questions should be various
aspects and topics involved in the selected area and individual criteria. The set of
questions asked to any individual subject will be auto-generated by an intelligent system,
which will measure the previous responses of the subject and asks new questions to
reach an accurate measurements.
